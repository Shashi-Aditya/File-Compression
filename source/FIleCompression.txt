Automate file compression using Huffman’s Coding
Objectives:
To create a program which take a file (basic PDF) and convert it into compressed file.
The program should also be able to take an entrire directory, and compress all of its
contents and store all the compressed files in new directory.
Algorithm :
All the compression will be done by Huffman’s coding.
